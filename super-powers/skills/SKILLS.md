# SKILLS.md

**This is a conceptual skill taxonomy** — a comprehensive catalogue of capability categories and descriptions. It is *not* a registry of implemented skills. For the list of skills that have been built and are ready to use, see [`skill-registry.md`](./skill-registry.md).

## Usage Rule

- Agents manage work.
- Skills execute reusable capabilities.
- Workflows sequence skills.
- Outputs should be saved to `/docs/agent-outputs/`.
