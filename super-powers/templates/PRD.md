## Design Direction

The design should evoke a **bustling marketplace meets community forum**—vibrant, energetic, and addictive. Think neon signs in a night market combined with the familiarity of Reddit. Colors are bold and eye-catching. The news ticker pulses with urgency. The activity sidebar creates a sense of constant motion. Every element screams "things are happening here."
