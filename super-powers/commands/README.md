# Commands

This directory contains slash command and CLI command definitions for the AI automation framework.

## Purpose

Commands provide shorthand triggers that invoke agents, run workflows, or execute scripts. They can be used from the Copilot chat interface (slash commands) or from the terminal (CLI commands).

## Planned Command Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Slash commands | `/init-project`, `/create-agent`, `/run-workflow`, etc. |
| CLI commands | `generate_agent.py`, `generate_skill.py` (see `scripts/`) |
| Agent commands | Direct agent invocations with pre-set context |
| Workflow commands | Single-line triggers for numbered workflows |
