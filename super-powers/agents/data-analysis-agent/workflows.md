# Data Analysis Agent — Workflows

## Participating Workflows

### WF-03: data-analysis
- **Role**: Analyzes cleaned dataset; computes summary statistics, distributions, correlations, and key insights
- **Receives from**: data-cleanup-agent (cleaned dataset, quality report)
- **Produces**: Analysis report (metrics, insights, outlier flags), feature importance hints
- **Hands off to**: model-development-agent and stats-visualization-agent

## Integration Points

| System / Agent | Integration Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| orchestrator-agent | Receives task assignment | Dispatch point for WF-03 |
| data-cleanup-agent | Receives cleaned dataset | Must confirm quality gate before proceeding |
| model-development-agent | Sends analysis report | Feature importance and correlation data |
| stats-visualization-agent | Sends analysis report | Drives chart and dashboard design |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/data-analysis-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
4. Notify orchestrator of completion
