- **Hands off to**: project-planner-agent

### WF-01: data-collection
- **Role**: Routes data-collection tasks; confirms data agents are ready
- **Receives from**: project-planner-agent (approved plan)
- **Produces**: Task assignments for data-cleanup-agent
- **Hands off to**: data-cleanup-agent

### WF-10: launch-review

## Integration Points

| System / Agent | Integration Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| All 13 specialist agents | Task dispatch and status receipt | Central hub for all inter-agent communication |
| project-planner-agent | Receives plan; dispatches WF-01 onward | First downstream agent |
| repo-maintenance-agent | Receives final health report | Last technical gate before launch |
| User / external trigger | Receives project brief; reports blockers | Only escalation path outside the system |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/orchestrator-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
4. Notify orchestrator of completion
