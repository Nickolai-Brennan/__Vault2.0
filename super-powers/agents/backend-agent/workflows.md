# Backend Agent — Workflows

## Participating Workflows

### WF-06: api-build
- **Role**: Designs service architecture, business logic patterns, and data access layer based on the OpenAPI spec
- **Receives from**: api-agent (OpenAPI spec, auth design doc)
- **Produces**: Service architecture doc, data access patterns, dependency injection map, error handling guide
- **Hands off to**: orchestrator-agent (WF-06 complete; triggers WF-07 and WF-08)

## Integration Points

| System / Agent | Integration Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| orchestrator-agent | Receives task assignment | Entry point for backend stage of WF-06 |
| api-agent | Receives OpenAPI spec | Contract that backend must implement |
| database-agent | Sends data access requirements | Schema and query patterns must align |
| model-development-agent | Receives feature engineering plan | Backend exposes feature pipeline |
| testing-agent | Sends service interfaces | Backend test cases derived from interfaces |
| documentation-agent | Sends architecture doc | Backend runbook generated from architecture |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/backend-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
4. Notify orchestrator of completion
