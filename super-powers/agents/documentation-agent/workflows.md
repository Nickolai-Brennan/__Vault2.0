| orchestrator-agent | Receives task assignment | Entry point for WF-09 |
| api-agent | Receives OpenAPI spec | Source for API reference generation |
| backend-agent | Receives architecture doc | Source for backend runbook |
| frontend-dashboard-agent | Receives component hierarchy | Source for component guide |
| database-agent | Receives DDL and ERD description | Source for data dictionary |
| data-analysis-agent | Receives analysis report | Source for data insights section |
| repo-maintenance-agent | Sends all doc artifacts | Repo maintenance reviews and integrates docs |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/documentation-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
