# Model Development Agent — Workflows

## Participating Workflows

### WF-04: model-development
- **Role**: Designs scoring/ML model spec, feature engineering plan, and evaluation framework
- **Receives from**: data-analysis-agent (analysis report, feature importance hints)
- **Produces**: Model spec YAML, feature engineering plan, evaluation framework, bias assessment
- **Hands off to**: orchestrator-agent (triggers WF-05, WF-06, WF-07 in parallel)

## Integration Points

| System / Agent | Integration Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| orchestrator-agent | Receives task assignment | Dispatches WF-04 after WF-03 completes |
| data-analysis-agent | Receives analysis report | Foundation for all feature decisions |
| stats-visualization-agent | Sends model spec | Drives model performance visualization |
| backend-agent | Sends feature engineering plan | Backend must expose feature pipeline |
| database-agent | Sends data requirements | Schema must support feature storage |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/model-development-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
4. Notify orchestrator of completion
