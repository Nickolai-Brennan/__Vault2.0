# API Agent — Workflows

## Participating Workflows

### WF-06: api-build
- **Role**: Designs REST/GraphQL contracts, OpenAPI specs, auth requirements, and error schemas
- **Receives from**: orchestrator-agent (model spec, database schema, business requirements)
- **Produces**: OpenAPI 3.x spec, auth design doc, error schema reference
- **Hands off to**: backend-agent

## Integration Points

| System / Agent | Integration Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| orchestrator-agent | Receives task assignment | Entry point for WF-06 |
| database-agent | Receives schema artifacts | Resource models must match DB schema |
| model-development-agent | Receives model spec | API must expose model inference endpoints |
| backend-agent | Sends OpenAPI spec | Backend implements the contract defined here |
| testing-agent | Sends OpenAPI spec | Contract tests derived from spec |
| documentation-agent | Sends OpenAPI spec | API reference generated from spec |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/api-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
4. Notify orchestrator of completion
