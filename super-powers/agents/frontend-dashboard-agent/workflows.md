# Frontend Dashboard Agent — Workflows

## Participating Workflows

### WF-05: dashboard-build
- **Role**: Translates chart and layout specs into component hierarchy, page layouts, and data-binding contracts
- **Receives from**: stats-visualization-agent (chart specs, layout spec, accessibility report)
- **Produces**: Component hierarchy, page layout specs, data-binding contracts, accessibility audit
- **Hands off to**: orchestrator-agent (WF-05 complete; triggers WF-08)

## Integration Points

| System / Agent | Integration Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| orchestrator-agent | Receives task assignment | Entry point for frontend stage of WF-05 |
| stats-visualization-agent | Receives chart and layout specs | Upstream design authority |
| api-agent | Consumes OpenAPI spec | Data-binding contracts must match API endpoints |
| testing-agent | Sends component specs | Frontend test cases derived from component hierarchy |
| documentation-agent | Sends component hierarchy | Component guide generated from specs |

## Handoff Protocol

### Receiving a task
1. Read the handoff_notes from the upstream agent
2. Validate that all required inputs are present
3. If inputs are missing, surface the gap to the orchestrator before proceeding

### Completing a task
1. Produce all required outputs in the standard YAML format
2. Write output to `docs/agent-outputs/frontend-dashboard-agent/`
3. Set `next_agent` and populate `handoff_notes`
4. Notify orchestrator of completion
