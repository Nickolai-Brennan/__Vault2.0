# Automation: Weekly Roadmap Review

## Purpose
Review roadmap milestones every Monday to track progress, surface risks, and update the risk register.

## Schedule
- **Frequency**: Weekly
- **Time**: 10:00 UTC every Monday
- **Trigger type**: Schedule

## Steps
1. Load `roadmap.md` and `milestones.md` from the project output directory.
2. Compare each milestone target date against today; flag any milestone past due.
3. Check `tasks/completed-tasks.md` for milestones marked done; update milestone status.
4. Review `risk_register.md`; flag any risk with likelihood HIGH or impact HIGH that has no recent mitigation update.
5. Post weekly progress summary as a GitHub discussion or issue.

## Inputs
- `docs/agent-outputs/project-planner-agent/roadmap.md`
- `docs/agent-outputs/project-planner-agent/milestones.md`
- `docs/agent-outputs/project-planner-agent/risk_register.md`
- `tasks/completed-tasks.md`

## Outputs / Notifications
- `weekly-roadmap-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Notification channel**: GitHub issue titled "Weekly Roadmap Review — YYYY-MM-DD"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All milestones reviewed and status updated
- [ ] Past-due milestones flagged with owner mentioned
- [ ] High-severity risks reviewed

## Error Handling
| Scenario | Response |
|---|---|
| `roadmap.md` missing | Post warning issue; request project-planner-agent to regenerate |
| No milestones found | Log and post "Roadmap not yet defined" |

## Safety Rules
- Never commit or log secrets found during scan
- Require human review before modifying roadmap files
- Read-only access to all project documents
