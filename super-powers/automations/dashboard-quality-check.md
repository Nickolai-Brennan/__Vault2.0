# Automation: Dashboard Quality Check

## Purpose
Validate daily that all dashboards load correctly, display fresh data, and have no broken charts or failed data fetches.

## Schedule
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Time**: 07:00 UTC
- **Trigger type**: Schedule

## Steps
1. Load the dashboard registry from `docs/agent-outputs/stats-visualization-agent/visualization_specs.md`.
2. For each dashboard, send an HTTP request to the dashboard URL and verify HTTP 200 response.
3. Check each data source endpoint referenced in `component_plan.md`; verify response is non-empty and within expected row-count range.
4. Check the last-updated timestamp of each data source; flag if older than the defined refresh interval.
5. Post status report; create a GitHub issue for any failed dashboard or stale data source.

## Inputs
- `docs/agent-outputs/stats-visualization-agent/visualization_specs.md`
- `docs/agent-outputs/frontend-dashboard-agent/component_plan.md`
- Dashboard URL registry

## Outputs / Notifications
- `dashboard-health-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Notification channel**: GitHub issue (on failure) titled "Dashboard Quality Failure — <dashboard-name>"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All dashboards return HTTP 200
- [ ] No data source stale beyond its refresh interval
- [ ] Report posted before 07:30 UTC

## Error Handling
| Scenario | Response |
|---|---|
| Dashboard URL unreachable | Retry twice; then create failure issue |
| Data source returns empty response | Flag as stale; create issue |
| `component_plan.md` missing | Log warning; check only URL reachability |

## Safety Rules
- Never commit or log secrets found during scan
- Use read-only service account for all HTTP checks
- Do not modify dashboard configuration during check
