## Directory Conventions

### `.github/`
- `copilot-instructions.md` — This file. Defines repo conventions for GitHub Copilot and all AI agents working in this repo.

### `Actions/`
- **`Doc Creation/`** — Templates that define the metadata shape of a new document (title, type, owner, status, tags). Copy a template, fill in the front-matter, and move the finished doc to `Docs/`.

### `Automations/`
All reusable AI automation assets live here.

| Sub-folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Agents/` | `.agent.md` files that define an AI agent's persona, goals, and tool access. |
| `Instructions/` | Reference guides explaining *how* to author each asset type (agents, prompts, skills, etc.). |
| `Prompts/` | Standalone, reusable prompt templates. Use `{{placeholders}}` for variable inputs. |
| `Skills/` | Deterministic, single-responsibility capability definitions. Skills are composed into agents. |
| `Information/` | Knowledge files and data sources injected as context at runtime. |
| `master-list.md` | The canonical index of every file in `Automations/`. Update it whenever you add or remove a file. |

### `Docs/`
Human-readable project documentation.

| Sub-folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KBD/` | Knowledge-base documents — reference material, FAQs, glossaries. |
| `PRD/` | Product requirement documents — feature specs, user stories, acceptance criteria. |
| `Technical/` | Technical specs — architecture decisions, API contracts, data models. |

### `System/`
Meta-information about the repository itself.
- `architecture.md` — High-level system architecture diagram and narrative.
- `changelog.md` — Human-readable log of significant changes to the repo structure or major decisions.

### `Workflow/`
Process documents that govern *how* work is done in this repo.
- `AI Execution Methods.md` — The master AI orchestration meta-prompt and decision framework.
- `Guide.md` — The 9-step execution lifecycle for shipping any feature or document.

### Root files
- `In Action.md` — Live tracker of active tasks, owners, and status.
- `Master Stack.txt` — The full technology stack reference for this project.

## Authoring Guidelines

1. **Front-matter** — Every Markdown file should start with YAML front-matter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: ""
   type: ""        # agent | prompt | skill | doc | spec | guide
   status: draft   # draft | review | active | archived
   owner: ""
   updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   ---
   ```
2. **Naming** — Use `kebab-case` for file names in `Automations/`. Use `Title Case` for files in `Docs/` and `Workflow/`.
3. **Master list** — After adding any file to `Automations/`, add an entry to `Automations/master-list.md`.
4. **In Action tracker** — Move tasks through `Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done` columns in `In Action.md`.
5. **Changelog** — Record every structural change or major decision in `System/changelog.md`.
